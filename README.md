## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

In this current Project on html, css and js, that I am currently engaging on, this would have to be the most time consuming project I have engaged in. There are lots of details that has to be paid attention to and which has to be seen in ones coding. My JS file may seem off but, the functionalities needed for this project to meet the required was met. What I learnt concerning this project is that time is consumed when a website to be coded contains too much details and one has to pay attention to this many details.


### Continued development

Still more to develop on my web development skills. JS knowledge has to be improved on.
One more important part to work on is styling to look nice on mobile view. My styling in this project is not looking nice. Bellow is a snippet of this project on mobile view. You can view the live site by clicking [here](https://your-live-site-url.com)
